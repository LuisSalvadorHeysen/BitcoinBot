A comprehensive, educational algorithmic trading bot suite for both SPY (S&P 500 ETF) and Bitcoin (BTC/USD) that demonstrates machine learning, backtesting, and explainable AI (XAI) in both stock and crypto trading. This project is designed for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning about algorithmic trading and data science in finance.

## üéØ Overview

This project walks you through building realistic trading bots using:
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest and Linear Regression models
- **Technical Analysis**: 18+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- **Historical Data**: Model training and backtesting on years of SPY or BTC data
- **Realistic Backtesting**: Transaction fees, slippage, and portfolio management
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP analysis for model interpretability
- **Performance Analytics**: Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and trade logging

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. **Fetch Historical Data**: Download years of SPY price data from Yahoo Finance or BTC/USD from CoinGecko.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate technical indicators and price-based features.
3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (Random Forest or Linear Regression) on historical data.
4. **Backtesting**: Simulate trades using the trained model, including fees and slippage.
5. **Walk-Forward Out-of-Sample Test**: For crypto, simulate trading on the last week using only past data at each step (realistic paper trading simulation).
6. **Performance Analysis**: Visualize results, compute Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and analyze feature importance with SHAP.
7. **Live Prediction (Optional, stocks)**: Use the trained model to make live predictions on the latest SPY data.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Typical Workflow
```bash
# 1. Stock: Fetch and save historical SPY data (automatically done in main.py)
python main.py

# 2. Stock: Run backtesting simulation on historical data
python backtest.py

# 3. Stock: Run advanced backtesting with technical indicators and SHAP analysis
python advanced_backtest.py

# 4. Crypto: Run walk-forward out-of-sample backtest (BTC/USD, CoinGecko)
python crypto_backtest.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Trading Parameters (edit in the scripts)
```python
FEE_RATE = 0.001        # 0.1% transaction fee
SLIPPAGE_RATE = 0.0005  # 0.05% price slippage
HOLD_THRESHOLD = 0.0005 # 0.05% minimum move to trade
INITIAL_CASH = 10000    # Starting capital (crypto)
```

### Model Settings
```python
WINDOW = 60             # Training window size
FEATURE_COLUMNS = 18    # Number of technical indicators
MODEL_TYPE = "RandomForest"  # ML algorithm choice
```

## üìä Technical Indicators

The bots use 18+ technical indicators:
- **Moving Averages**: SMA (5, 20), EMA (12, 26)
- **Momentum**: RSI, MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram
- **Volatility**: Bollinger Bands (Upper, Middle, Lower)
- **Price Action**: Price changes (1, 5, 10 periods)
- **Volume**: Volume ratios (when available)

## üéì Educational Value

This project demonstrates:
- **Data Science**: Feature engineering, model training, and validation
- **Financial Engineering**: Backtesting, risk management, and performance analysis
- **Software Engineering**: Clean code, modular design, and documentation
- **Machine Learning**: Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretability

---

## üßπ Clean Up & Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing columns (e.g., 'timestamp'), ensure you are using the latest code and have run `main.py` at least once.
- If you want to start fresh, you can delete old CSVs in `project3/data/`.
- For Python version issues, use Python 3.8+.
- For plotting errors, ensure you have a working matplotlib installation (no GUI needed).
